                          --------------

Files here are meant to be somehow related to opencog, and yet not
central to its operation.

 * embodiment directory has embodiment related scripts. Note that the
   embodiment component is in the midst of being re-implemented and
   might not currently work.

 * run_chatbot_and_servers.sh - run the cogserver, the RelEx server, and the
   cogita chat-bot in the tabs of a gnome-terminal.
