"
  Find answers (i.e., similar sentences that share some keyword) from
  the Atomspace by using the fuzzy pattern matcher. By default, it
  excludes sentences with TruthQuerySpeechAct and InterrogativeSpeechAct.

  Accepts a SentenceNode as the input.
  Returns one or more sentence strings -- the answers.

  For example:
     (get-answers (car (nlp-parse \"What did Pete eat?\")))
  OR:
     (get-answers (SentenceNode \"sentence@123\"))

  Possible result:
     (Pete ate apples .)
