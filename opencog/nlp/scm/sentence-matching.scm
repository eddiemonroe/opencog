; Find answers (i.e., similar sentences that share some keyword) from the
; Atomspace by using the fuzzy pattern matcher. By default, it excludes
; sentences with TruthQuerySpeechAct and InterrogativeSpeechAct.
;
; Accepts either an actual sentence or a SentenceNode as the input. Also accepts
; an optional argument "exclude-list" which is a list of atoms that we don't want
; them to exist in the hypergraphs of the answers. By default they are
; (DefinedLinguisticConceptNode "TruthQuerySpeechAct") and (DefinedLinguisticConceptNode "InterrogativeSpeechAct").
;
; Returns one or more sentences -- the answers.
;
; For example:
;    (get-answers "What did Pete eat?")
; OR:
;    (get-answers (SentenceNode "sentence@123"))
;
; Possible result:
;    (Pete ate apples .)
